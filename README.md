# RayTracing
a simple ray tracer that is capable of rendering simple mathematical objects. A simple camera model and lighting model will be adopted. The learning objectives of this small project are:    Practical application of the ray tracing algorithm Better understanding of a simple lighting model Enforcing the concepts of ray intersection and normals
